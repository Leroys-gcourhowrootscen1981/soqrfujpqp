Just walked out of seeing Heart Eyes or maybe it walked out of me. My eyes are still adjusting to reality like I've been staring at the sun too long, and let’s be honest, who decided it'd be a good idea to have films feel like a fever dream? Half of me is annoyed, kind of like after eating popcorn and finding three pieces stuck in your teeth. Crunch crunch, and not in a good way.

So, this thing, Heart Eyes – it’s like they took a blender, threw in rainbows, heartbreak, and a twist of existential dread. Hit puree and splat, there it is on the screen. Someone had the bright idea to make every scene look like it was shot through a kaleidoscope coated in honey. Visual sugar rush much? But all of a sudden, a moment hits making you feel like you're staring at a painting that’s looking back at you. Weirdly unsettling, but I dig it?

> I swear, the lead actress’s face should be considered a national landmark. “Resting Heart eyes” could be a thing. Do people already say that? Is that a meme? Whatever. She's there with all her stunning close-ups that feel just a tad invasive, and yet you're strapped in, and it’s like, maybe I should invest in more eye contact in my life.

Plot-wise? Ha! Let’s just say, I took more notes during Algebra II than the writers did here. It's like they filmed a dream someone had after eating too much cheese and decided we could all just fill in the blanks. Not complaining, though, you just have to be okay with feeling as clueless as a goldfish in a library.

Random JavaScript because why not:
```javascript
var heartEyes = function(love, confusion) {
    return love  Math.random() + confusion;
}
console.log(heartEyes(10, 5));
```

Do I recommend you download this movie? Meh, sure. Watch the movie if you’ve got two hours and nothing better to do or if you’re feeling like tossing your brain into a blender set to pulse. You might just find yourself walking out like me, a little dazed, slightly awed, definitely confused, and with the lingering question: why did I just watch that?
